            <p>
                It is estimated that $2.6 billion is spent on drug development, but a large 
                amount of that money is essentially wasted since 9 out of 10 drugs never make 
                it to market. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Researchers developing new medicines are now able to use robots in order to 
                analyze billions of data points, in order to predict and prove hypotheses. 
                This saves both money and time.
